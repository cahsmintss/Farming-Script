Some time ago I made JAVA farming script for hypixel skyblock and I think it's good time to make it public.

(READ!!!! : Download and run it 1 time before you do anything! If you do not, the script doesnt work!)

Features:

failsafe

works in background

multiple accounts

Before you start macroing make sure your attack keybind is "v" (otherwise it wont break blocks), and make sure to have text macros set up correctly (otherwise failsafe wont work)

If you turn on script you will need to enter your minecraft PID (you can get this by going to task manager -> details -> javaw.exe, https://imgur.com/a/hM6h1k6)

EDIT: remember, every time you restart minecraft pid is different

Also make sure your speed is 120

3rd edit: to disable pause on alt tab press f3 + p
